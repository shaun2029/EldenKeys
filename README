Elden Keys - Elden Ring Linux keyboard macros

Elden Ring Key Binds
    1 = ESC
    2 = E+UpArrow
    3 = E+RightArrow
    4 = E+DownArrow
    5 = E+LeftArrow
    CAPS = LeftShift

Launch in terminal like:
    ./EldenKeys /dev/input/by-id/usb-Logitech_G513_Carbon_Tactile_056E38673132-event-kbd

Where you will need to find your keyboard in /dev/input/by-id/
But we have the same keyboards  (edited)

NOTE: You will need to add your user to the 'input' group if you do not want to run it as root.

Building:
    Use the script make.sh
    or
    gcc EldenKeys.c -lX11 -lc -lXmu -o EldenKeys

Depends on:
    libx11-dev
    libxmu-dev
    libc
